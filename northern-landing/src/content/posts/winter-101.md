# Dressing for Winter, Province by Province

You thought one puffy jacket was enough. Canada laughed. The truth is, winter isn’t one-size-fits-all here. Each province has its own brand of misery—and fashion hacks to survive it.

## Ontario: The Slush Olympics

Toronto winters aren’t just cold, they’re wet.  

- Your stylish boots? Destroyed in one week by salt stains.  
- Invest in waterproof boots (Sorel, Kamik, or even Canadian Tire specials).  
- **Pro tip:** keep baby wipes by the door—your shoes will look like they wrestled a snowplow otherwise.

## Alberta: Layer Like an Onion

The weather app is lying to you. It’ll say “−10°C,” but with a chinook wind, you’re sweating in a hoodie by afternoon.  

**Solution:** layers.  

- Long johns  
- Thermal tops  
- Fleece  
- Then your parka  

MEC is Alberta’s unofficial uniform, though Costco thermals work just fine.

## Quebec: Frostbite but Make It Fashion

Montrealers somehow manage to look like Vogue models while walking on black ice.  

**Trick:** hidden thermal layers under chic wool coats.  

- Want to fit in? → Quartz Co. or Kanuk  
- Don’t care? → Just don’t wear sneakers in January

## British Columbia: Wet, Not Cold

It rains. A lot.  

- Forget your parka—what you need is a waterproof jacket (Arc’teryx if you’re rich, Mountain Warehouse if you’re not).  
- Waterproof shoes are a must.  
- Nobody looks cool with soggy socks.

## The Bottom Line

👉 Dressing for winter in Canada isn’t about style, it’s about survival. Once you nail it, you’ll laugh at tourists shivering in “fashion jackets.”
