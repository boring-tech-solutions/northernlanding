# Your First Tim Hortons Order: A Rite of Passage

If you haven’t stood in line at Tim’s, you haven’t truly arrived in Canada. But ordering? That’s where things get tricky.  

---

## 1. The Double-Double Mystery

It’s not a wrestling move. It’s coffee with **two creams, two sugars.**  

If you don’t like sugar, say so—or prepare to buzz for 3 hours.  

---

## 2. The Menu Overload

There are Timbits (donut holes), steeped tea, and breakfast sandwiches that taste better at 6 a.m. than 6 p.m.  

Don’t panic—just pick one.

## 3. What Canadians Actually Order

- **Mornings:** double-double or steeped tea  
- **Road trips:** large iced capp (yes, even in -20°C)  
- **Kids:** box of Timbits (parents eat half)

## 4. How Not to Freeze at the Counter

Practice your order in your head:  

“Medium double-double, please.”  

Repeat three times before your turn. This is your initiation.

## The Bottom Line

👉 **Tip:** Nobody cares if you mispronounce it. Half the fun is learning. Bonus points if you grab a **Roll Up the Rim** cup and act shocked when you lose.
