# How to Network When You’re New to a City (Without Being Weird About It)

So you’ve just landed in a new city. You’ve unpacked your suitcase, realized your winter jacket isn’t actually *“Canadian winter”* ready, and now you’re wondering… how do I meet people without looking like I’m trying too hard? Good news: making connections here doesn’t have to feel like speed dating gone wrong. Let’s break it down.

## 1. Set a Goal (Yes, Like Homework)

Networking sounds big, but really it’s just “making friends, but on purpose.”

- **If you’re an introvert:** Aim small. One good conversation a month is enough. Think of it like collecting Pokémon—quality over quantity.
- **If you’re an extrovert:** Try not to scare people by adopting ten “best friends” in one week. Aim for consistency, not chaos.

> 👉 A realistic goal: “One new friend a month.” That’s 12 new humans by the end of the year—boom, you’ve got a squad.

## 2. Find Places Where People Hide (Hint: Not Your Couch)

You’ve got to go where the people are. The trick? Pick something you actually like—or at least something you can tolerate without eye-rolling.

- Love books? → Libraries and book clubs.
- Can tolerate dancing (but mostly like the snacks)? → Community salsa night.
- Hate small talk but love soccer? → Join a local league.
- Faith and culture? → Church, mosque, temple, or cultural associations are goldmines.
- And yes… even that pub down the street. (Half of Canada’s friendships start over beer or bad karaoke.)

## 3. Dress for Success (and Don’t Smell Like a Transit Bus)

You don’t need a designer suit—this isn’t LinkedIn Live. Just:

- Wear something clean.
- Smell like you’ve met soap.
- Bonus: a small detail that sparks conversation (a funny T-shirt, cool sneakers, cultural accessory).

*Remember:* Canadians compliment shoes a lot. I don’t know why. It’s basically national policy.

## 4. Who to Approach (Without Being Creepy)

Look for immediate common ground:

- Parents standing by the playground → Easy. “How old is yours? Oh, mine still eats sand. Yours too?”
- Someone driving the same car → “Nice Civic. Mine makes a weird noise, does yours?”
- At an event → The other person awkwardly standing alone with a plate of food. Perfect.

## 5. How to Approach (Sample Dialogues Included 👇)

Opening lines don’t need to be Shakespeare. Keep it light:

- **At a community event:** “So, have you been here before, or are we both lost?”
- **At a coffee shop meetup:** “Hey, is this seat taken? I promise not to drink all your coffee.”
- **At a sports game:** “I’m still learning the rules. Can I cheer when everyone else does?”

> 👉 Tip: Smile. Canadians love smiles. Even in -30°C.

## 6. What’s Acceptable Follow-up?

This part freaks people out, but here’s the rule: **match the vibe.**

- Casual chat at a kids’ park → Swap phone numbers (“Hey, want to do another playdate?”).
- Met at a professional event → LinkedIn (safe, polite, no weirdness).
- Shared hobbies → WhatsApp groups or Messenger.

If you’re unsure, test the waters: “This was fun, should we swap numbers?”  
If they hesitate, back off with grace. You’ve got dignity (and still a whole city to meet).

## 7. The Secondary Meeting (aka Level 2 Friendship)

Don’t just say “we should hang out sometime.” That’s Canadian code for “never.” Instead, set something specific:

- “Want to grab coffee next week?”
- “Let’s hit that farmers’ market Saturday.”
- “Game night at my place—bring chips?”

If they say yes, congrats. You’re officially networking.  
If they say no, congrats—you practiced. Next!
