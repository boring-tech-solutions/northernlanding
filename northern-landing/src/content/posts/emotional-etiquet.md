# How Much Polite is Too Polite in Canada?

So, you’ve moved to the land of maple syrup, moose, and manners. Suddenly you’re saying “sorry” to the grocery cart, apologizing to the ATM, and even muttering “excuse me” when you sneeze alone at home.  

Here’s the truth: Canadians are polite, yes. But even politeness has boundaries.

## 1. Sorry vs. Sorry (The Canadian Double Standard)

- **Legit sorry:** You stepped on someone’s foot on the bus. Say it. Mean it.  
- **Polite sorry:** Someone bumped you. You still say it. Weird? Yes. Welcome to Canada.

## 2. When “Thank You” Becomes Too Much

At Tim Hortons:  

- **Barista:** “Here’s your coffee.”  
- **You:** “Thank you!”  
- **Them:** “No worries.”  
- **You:** “Thanks again!”  
- **Them:** “…Okay.”  

👉 Rule of thumb: Stop at **one ‘thank you.’** Two max.

## 3. The Weather Apology Rule

Never apologize for the weather. You didn’t cause the snowstorm.  

(Unless you’re from Winnipeg. Then… maybe.)

## The Bottom Line

👉 **Tip:** Politeness is great. Over-politeness = awkward. When in doubt, smile, nod, and keep it moving.
