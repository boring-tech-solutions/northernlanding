# The Unwritten Rules of Canadian Workplaces

Congrats on the job! Now comes the tricky part: fitting in. Canadian workplaces have rules no one tells you.  

---

## Weather = Safe Small Talk

Every Monday starts with: *“Cold enough for you?”*  

This isn’t boring—it’s bonding. Join in.  

---

## Meetings = Understatement Olympics

- *“We’ll circle back”* = “This is going nowhere.”  
- *“Interesting idea”* = “Probably not.”  
- *“Let’s keep this in mind”* = “We won’t.”  

Learn the code.

## Lunch Culture

- Microwave fish and curry at work? Bold move.  
- Stick to sandwiches, salads, or leftovers that don’t smell.  
- Yes, people eat at their desks—but if invited to group lunch, **go.** It matters.

## The Bottom Line

👉 **Tip:** Casual Friday is casual, not lazy. Jeans are fine. Pajamas? Not so much.
