# The Canadian Medical System: A Beginner’s Survival Guide

You’ve got a fever. Do you go to the ER? A walk-in? Or do you just drink ginger tea and pray? Relax—we’ve all been confused at first.  

Here’s how the Canadian medical system works when you’re new:

## Family Doctor (aka Unicorn)

Hard to find, but worth the hunt.  

- Your family doctor is your go-to for prescriptions, check-ups, and referrals to specialists.  
- If you find one accepting patients, grab that spot like it’s a **Black Friday deal.**  

---

## Walk-In Clinics

Got strep throat, ear infection, or a mysterious rash? Walk-ins are your friend.  

- No appointment needed.  
- Expect to wait (bring a book or podcast).  

---

## Emergency Rooms

Not for colds.  

- **ER is for:** chest pain, broken bones, scary bleeding.  
- The wait can be hours.  
- You’ll see people knitting, sleeping, or even ordering pizza while waiting.

## Telehealth / 811

Call this free number.  

- A nurse answers, asks questions, and tells you if you need ER, a clinic, or just rest.  
- A lifesaver at 2 a.m. when you’re panicking.

## The Bottom Line

👉 **Tip:** Be specific about your symptoms.  

❌ “My tummy hurts”  
✅ *“Sharp pain, lower right side, started 3 hours ago.”*  

Clearer = faster help.
