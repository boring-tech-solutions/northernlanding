# Driving & Pedestrian Etiquette: Who Goes First (and Why Everyone Waves)

You’ve got your license, your car, and now you’re wondering: why is everyone waving at me?

## Four-Way Stops = Confusion Olympics

- **Rule:** whoever arrives first goes first.  
- **Reality:** everyone waves at everyone else.  
- If you freeze, Canadians will wait patiently… and then wave again.

## Pedestrians: The True Rulers

At crosswalks, cars stop. Always.  

- Even if you hesitate, they’ll wait—smiling politely while secretly freezing to death.  
- But don’t abuse it. Cross like a normal human, not in slow motion.

## The Wave

The “thank you” wave is law.  

- Someone lets you merge? **Wave.**  
- They stop for you? **Wave.**  
- Forget to wave? You’re basically on a watchlist.

## The Bottom Line

👉 **Tip:** Roundabouts exist here. Don’t panic. Enter, keep right, and exit. And yes, Canadians will still wave.
